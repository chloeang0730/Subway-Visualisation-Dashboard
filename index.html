                    <span class="subway">Subway's</span> success in 2015 was attributed to its <span class="location">aggressive franchising methods</span>, <span class="location">appealing startup costs</span>, and <span class="location">adaptability in menu offerings</span>. Actively seeking franchisees and providing a straightforward process facilitated rapid global expansion. The franchise's affordability and flexible location options attracted many entrepreneurs, distinguishing it from competitors.
                    Moreover,<span class="subway">Subway's</span> menu modifications, such as introducing fresh vegetables, lean meats, and whole-grain bread, aligned with shifting consumer preferences toward healthier options. This focus on nutritious choices catered to an increasingly health-conscious demographic, contributing significantly to their widespread appeal during that period.<br>
                    
                    <span class="subway">Subway's</span> decline post-2015 resulted from <span class="location">intensified competition</span>, stemming from a changing fast-food landscape. Additionally, <span class="location">the scandal involving their former spokesperson</span>, <span class="location">evolving consumer preferences </span>favoring fresher and more diverse options, and  <span class="location">franchisee discontent over operational support</span> and <span class="location">fund management</span> contributed to the downward trajectory. 
                    <span class="location">Overexpansion </span>led to compromised quality control, damaging their reputation. These factors collectively challenged <span class="subway">Subway's</span> market dominance, underscoring the need for comprehensive strategic reforms to revive its brand image and sustain competitiveness.
